# CryptoMon

An dapp running on the ethereum platform that allows you to adopt pokemon!
Inspired by the dapp on http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop.

This app is built for myself to understand how ethereum works and how to integrate it to a node application.

## Technologies Used

http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/ethereum-overview
- Ethereum
- Truffle
- lite-server
- Node.js
- Solidity

- metamask (chrome extension that allows for ether transactions)

compile
migrate

npm run dev
```
