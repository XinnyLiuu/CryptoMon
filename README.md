# CryptoMon

An dapp running on the ethereum platform that allows you to adopt pokemon!
Inspired by the dapp on http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop.

This app is built for myself to understand how ethereum works and how to integrate it to a node application.

## Technologies Used

http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/ethereum-overview
- Ethereum
- Truffle
- lite-server
- Node.js
- Solidity

- metamask (chrome extension that allows for ether transactions)
https://metamask.io/

### Setting up metamask

Before running the app, make sure to install https://metamask.io/ on the Chrome browser.

For development purposes, we will restore the default seed used by Truffle Develop on metamask:

```
candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat
```

### Running the app

Assuming that you have npm installed:

```
npm install
npm install -g truffle

truffle develop
compile
migrate

npm run dev
```

Adopt away !
